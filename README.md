## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of plant seedlings using deep learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify different types of plant species or determine the health status of seedlings based on input images.

## Dataset
Describe the dataset you're using. Include information about the number of classes, the size of the dataset, and any preprocessing steps you've applied. Mention whether the dataset is publicly available or if you collected it yourself.

## Getting Started
Provide instructions on setting up the project on a local machine. Include any prerequisites, installation steps for required libraries, and data download or preprocessing instructions.

## Usage
Explain how to use your project. If you've created scripts or notebooks, provide a brief overview of their functionality and how to run them.

## Model Selection
Discuss your choice of model architecture. If you're using a pre-trained model, mention the reasons behind your selection. You can also include a high-level overview of the architecture.

## Training
Detail the steps to train your model. Include information about splitting the dataset, hyperparameter tuning, and any data augmentation techniques you've used. If you've used transfer learning, explain how you adapted the pre-trained model to your task.
 

## Evaluation
Explain how you evaluated your model's performance. Include the metrics you used (e.g., accuracy, precision, recall) and how well your model performed on the validation and testing datasets.

## Deployment
Discuss how you deployed your trained model for making predictions. If you've created a deployment script, web app, or integrated the model elsewhere, provide instructions on how to access and use the deployed model.

## Contributing
If you're open to contributions, provide guidelines for other developers or researchers who might want to contribute to your project. This could include instructions on how to report issues, submit pull requests, and the coding standards you follow.
