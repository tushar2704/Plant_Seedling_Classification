## Overview

This project focuses on the classification of plant seedlings using deep learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately identify different types of plant species or determine the health status of seedlings based on input images.

### Web App comming soon!

## Dataset
Dataset include 4430 files belonging to 12 classes. Dataset is publicly available [here](https://vision.eng.au.dk/?download=/data/WeedData/NonsegmentedV2.zip)

## Getting Started
The list of Species is as follows:

    Black-grass ,Charlock Cleavers, Common Chickweed ,Common wheat ,Fat Hen, Loose Silky-bent ,Maize, Scentless Mayweed, Shepherds Purse, Small-flowered Cranesbill ,Sugar beet

This is an plant seedling classification.I used transfer learning to classify images. The goal is to develop a model that can give more accuracy on the different species of plant.
